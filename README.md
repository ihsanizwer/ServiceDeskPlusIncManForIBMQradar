# ServiceDeskPlusIncManForIBMQradar
In this script I have demonstrated how ServiceDeskPlus could be used as an Incident Management tool for IBM Qradar. For this purpose I have used the RESTful APIs made available by both the products. All in all this is a great option as there is a free option for Service Desk plus and therefore you can get Incident Management of the SIEM done for almost free. I have tested this script on IBM Qradar server backend myself BTW. Therefore it is written in shell. I hope to elaborate more on the functionality of this in my blog. So stay tuned to: https://tech.ihsanizwer.tk
